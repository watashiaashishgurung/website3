        <td> As part of the Waze data team, I developed machine learning models to predict monthly user churn, aiming to enhance user retention. We compared Random Forest and XGBoost models, with XGBoost achieving better performance. Key predictive features included km_per_hour and percent_sessions_in_last_month. Despite significant insights, the project highlighted the need for additional granular data to improve accuracy. This work showcases my ability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to solve user retention issues.</td>

    <td> As part of the TikTok data team, I developed a machine learning model to classify TikTok videos as either claims or opinions. This model aims to assist in prioritizing video reviews, particularly for identifying content that may violate TikTok's terms of service. By analyzing video engagement levels—such as view counts, like counts, share counts, and download counts—the model effectively distinguishes between claims and opinions. Two tree-based classification models, Random Forest and XGBoost, were tested, with the Random Forest model selected for its superior recall score of 0.995. The final model demonstrated near-perfect performance, misclassifying only 5 out of 3,817 samples. This project showcases my ability to leverage machine learning for content moderation and user engagement analysis on social media platforms.</td>

    <td> As part of the Automatidata data team, I developed a machine learning model to predict whether a taxi rider would be a generous tipper, defined as someone who tips 20% or more. This project aimed to support the interests of both taxi drivers and passengers by providing valuable insights into tipping behavior.</td>
